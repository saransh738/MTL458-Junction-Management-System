# Implemented a Junction Management System
## Problem Statement
We are required to implement a Junction management system. There are 4 lanes which intersect with each other. Trains can enter a lane from the directions as shown in the figure. 
North is top of the figure. Each lane can allow only one train to pass through it at a time. Each train is represented by an independent thread and it performs the following 3 functions, in order:
* Arrive Lane - arriveLane(): The front of the train arrives at the first intersection point in the lane.
* Cross Lane - crosslane (): The train crosses the lane.
* Exit Lane - exitlane(): The complete train exits the lane.
